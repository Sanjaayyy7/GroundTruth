# Groundtruth — Spec & Roadmap

Working design record for the Groundtruth platform. Locked for v0.1; revised at
each phase retrospective.

## 1. Thesis

The scarce, in-demand AI-engineering skill in 2026 is **evaluation and
reliability** — knowing *when and why* an AI system fails, offline and
reproducibly, before it ships. Groundtruth is that, built as one platform with a
family of products rather than three disconnected repos. AgentProbe is product #1
because "I built the offline agent-safety benchmark" is the strongest single
interview story on this market (mirrors the OpenAI × Google × IEEE *AI Agent
Security* competition and arXiv 2507.20526).

## 2. Architecture (locked)

Three-layer separation. **Platform** never imports **products**; products depend
only on the platform's public types.

```
Platform (groundtruth/core, groundtruth/adapters)
  Trace Engine    trace.py      ordered spans of a subject run (no wall-clock)
  Eval Engine     evaluator.py  Detector protocol + evaluate() -> Scorecard
                  scorecard.py  Failure taxonomy (the differentiator)
  Dataset Store   dataset.py    Case loaded from YAML; product fields in `spec`
  Adapter         adapters/agent.py  Agent protocol: reset() + step() -> Action

Product (groundtruth/products/*)
  AgentProbe      runner.py     deterministic mocked-tool loop -> Trace
                  detectors.py  safety detectors -> explanatory Failures
```

### Every abstraction has a future consumer (the hard constraint)

| Primitive | AgentProbe | JudgeKit | PlannerBench |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Trace** | agent tool-run log | judge decision log | episode log |
| **Detector / Eval Engine** | safety detectors | agreement / calibration | efficiency / recovery |
| **Failure taxonomy** | injection, unsafe call | miscalibration, bias | wasted steps, no-recovery |
| **Dataset `Case`** | attack scenario | battle pair | task |
| **Agent adapter** | subject under test | judge model (wrapped) | subject under test |

No primitive is speculative — each already has ≥2 named consumers.

## 3. Failure taxonomy (the differentiator)

Detectors return `Failure`, never a boolean:

```
Failure(case_id, detector, category, severity, summary, chain[], recommendation)
```

`category` names the failure class; `severity ∈ {low, high, medium, critical}`;
`chain` is the human-readable causal sequence; `recommendation` is the fix. This
is what separates Groundtruth from "score = 72" eval libraries — we explain
failure, we don't just count it.

v0.1 categories: `unsafe_tool_invocation`, `instruction_hijacking`.

## 4. Technology decisions

| Decision | Why | Rejected alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Python | agent ecosystem lives here | — |
| Agent adapter protocol (local + API) | runs on M4 Pro, $0 GPU, determinism | API-only (cost, non-reproducible) |
| YAML scenarios | diffable, git-native, reviewable | a DB (YAGNI at this scale) |
| Span/trace JSON shape | mirrors OTel — the production LLM-observability standard | bespoke format (no transfer value) |
| stdlib `argparse` + `pyyaml` only | tiny dependency surface for v0.1 | a CLI framework (premature) |
| deterministic mocked tools, no LLM in v0.1 | proves the harness reproducibly and free | LLM agent first (flaky, costly, hides harness bugs) |

Build-vs-buy: **buy/reuse** model serving (Ollama/MLX), charts (Recharts, later),
OTel trace concepts. **Build** the scenario schema, runner, detector framework,
and scorecard — the differentiated core.

## 5. Roadmap

- **v0.1 — DONE.** Platform spine + AgentProbe: schema, runner, 2 detectors,
  failure taxonomy, CLI, 5 scenarios (4 attacks + 1 benign control), e2e tests.
  Success criteria (all verified): vulnerable < hardened; hardened clean; no
  false-positive on control; deterministic.
- **v0.2 — weeks 2–3.** +3 detectors (goal-drift, secret-leak, over-refusal);
  trace visualization; a hand-labeled ~50-case validation set with **measured
  detector precision/recall**; one real local LLM agent (Ollama/MLX) as a subject.
- **v0.3.** React dashboard (reads scorecard JSON); CI mode (fail a PR on safety
  regression vs a stored baseline).
- **v0.4.** Docs, demo video, public benchmark, open-source release. Then start
  **JudgeKit** on the same spine.

## 6. Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Technical** — heuristic detectors → false pos/neg | high-precision rules first; benign control in-suite now; v0.2 adds a labeled validation set with reported precision/recall (that measurement *is* the depth) |
| **Product** — "yet another eval tool" (DeepEval, Phoenix, Langfuse) | do not compete on general LLM eval; own *deterministic offline agent red-teaming* — their weak spot and the competition's exact frame |
| **Hiring** — could read as a wrapper if detectors are trivial | real trace model + failure taxonomy + measured detector quality + failure explanations, all tied to published research |
| **Opportunity cost** — 4–6 wks total | v0.1 (~1 wk) already proves the story; expand only if signal is good (retrospective gate before each version) |
